<h3>Kalman Filter in Speech Enhancement </h3>
<h4>All MATLAB programs related to my undergraduate thesis </h4>

<p>Speech denoising is essential in real-time communication and an important preprocessing step in speech recognition 
and human cognition of vocal speech. This work is my undergraduate thesis, that applies the famous <b>Kalman Filter</b> to enhance
noisy speech downloaded from the <a href = "http://ecs.utdallas.edu/loizou/speech/noizeus/"> NOIZUES </a> database.</p> 
In addition, Kalman filter tuning is explored and a new algorithm is proposed in

this </a> paper. The AutoRegressive model of speech production is explained and optimum order selection is done by studying the Partial AutoCorrelation Function.
